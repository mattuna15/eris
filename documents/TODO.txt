Odd fixes/etc
=============

Kernel:
	Making the speaker work through the mouse port

Basic:
	Bodge single element else on its own :)
	Cannot CRUNCH in a procedure
	Garbage Collection & tester (? necessary)

Emulator:
	Nothing outstanding

ESP32:
	Figure out the 520k RAM issue ?
	Getting SPIFFS out of the ESP32

Sprite Editor :
	Arrow keys move about, Ctrl/Fire toggle pixel as moves.
	change selected sprite
	N/P Next/Prev sprite
