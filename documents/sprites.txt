Each sprite has:

current X,Y    (offset by 8,8)
current Status (if 0 sprite is not operational)
	bit 15 : 	set if needs redrawing
	bit 14 : 	horizontal flip
	bit 13 : 	vertical flip
	bit 8..11 : colour
	bit 0..7 : 	sprite graphic #

new X,Y,Status
	these are set to $FFFF when no change is made. When one is updated
	they are copied to current (except the redraw bit 15)

CLS turns sprites off. Sprite drawing is enabled by the SPRITE command which errors
if there is no sprite bitmaps.

SPRITE 1 TO x,y 		- move sprite
SPRITE 1 DRAW 12 		- set graphic #
SPRITE 1 INK 4 			- set colour #
SPRITE 1 FLIP n 		- set sprite flip bits

Sprite Repaint
==============

1) Erase / Check phase

	Clear all sprites current repaint bits.

	Look through each sprite in turn.
		If new Values anded together are not $FFFF, something has changed and
		that sprite needs redrawing.
			- 	If the sprite is actually on the screen
				-	Erase the sprite at its current position.
				- 	For every other sprite, check to see if it overlaps this one
					(don't bother if it is already marked for redrawing)
				-	If it does, set the redraw bit but we don't have to erase it if
					it doesn't change.
			- 	Copy the new X/Y/Status over as appropriate (e.g. if not $FFFF)					
			-	Set the redraw bit in the current status 
			- 	Reset the new values to $FFFF

2) Repaint Phase

	Look through each sprite in turn.
		If the repaint bit is set, then repaint it.
