+0 			x position. doesn't increment
+1 			y position. increments

+2 			data source can increment depends on bit 15.

+3 			high byte : 	
				pixel bits to write to 		(mask)
 			low byte:
				pixel data to write.		(colour)

				The high byte controls access. The low byte controls what is written there. 
				This depends on two things ; the pixel data, and the setting of bit 12
				which determines whether the VRAM is only updated when the pixel is set,
				or if it is cleared to 0 when the pixel is cleared.

+4 			control

				bit 15: 	if set, the data source doesn't increment
				bit 14:		if set reverse pixels (normally display in 15..0)
				bit 13:		if set xor the data source address with 15 when reading
							(vertical flips if on 16 word boundary)
				bit 12: 	if set, write background when pixel bit is 0
							(always writes colour when pixel bit is 1)
				bit 11..8: 	0
				bit 7..0 	horizontal size, pre decrements until 0.
							(so 16 counts 15..0 on each line)
