Sound system
============

Each sound channel operates similarly.

There is a queue of sound operators, each 1 word.

0tttttff fffffff

		Play note frequency setting fffffffff * 64 for ttttt / 20ths of a second.


1tttttff fffffff

		Add ffffffffff sign extended * 64 every 20th of a second for ttttt 20ths of a second

Experimentally these may change.		

+0 	time when this elapses. If zero then this is stopped, so if calculated
	time is 0 bodge it to 1 which is technically an error of 1/100s :)
+1 	current pitch, preserved if silent (e.g. zero)
+2 	current adjustment per 20th second.
+3	queue head offset
+4 	queue tail offset
+5 	start of queue
	end of queue

Delete beep and replace with 

	OSSoundConstant   t,f
	OSSoundVariable   t,f

	Add queue to manager

	Sound channel,time,frequency
	Slide channel,time,change

We *might* lose the noise channel :)
