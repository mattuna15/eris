Sound alternative
=================

AT PRESENT THIS DOES NOT WORK.

Version 1.1 of the TTGO VGA32 board does not have audio. As a replacement, audio is
output through pin 9 on the ESP32 which connects to the bottom right pin on the mouse
port which is not used.

Round about line 391 of the fabgl library soundgen.cpp , in function

void SoundGenerator::i2s_audio_init() there is a line

  i2s_set_dac_mode(I2S_DAC_CHANNEL_RIGHT_EN); // GPIO25

change into I2S_DAC_CHANNEL_LEFT_EN		which is GPIO26

(on my Linux box this is at .pio/libdeps/esp32/FabGL_ID6143/src/devdrivers from
the esp32 directory)
